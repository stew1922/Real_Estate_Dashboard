# Real_Estate_Dashboard
## Due October 24, 2020

* So sorry this is late!! I have completed all tasks except for designing the actual dashboard.  All the data views and functions are built.  
* Will have the dashboard completed by tomorrow, October 26

* Now complete- admittedly, the dashboard itself leaves some room to be desired.  I think all of the tools built for this homework could be placed on one tab with the map being central and prominent.  The Average Price by Neighborhood should be in the top left so that you are inclined to pick the negighborhood before diving into the rest of the dashboard.
* I will be updating the dashboard over the next few days, but I wanted to get a body of work over to y'all so that it could be graded.  Again, apologies on the lateness
